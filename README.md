# RiceDataset
Data Set Name: Rice Dataset (Commeo and Osmancik)
Abstract: A total of 3810 rice grain's images were taken for the two species (Cammeo and Osmancik), processed and feature inferences were made. 7 morphological features were obtained for each grain of rice.	


Relevant Information: In order to classify the rice varieties (Cammeo and Osmancik) used, preliminary processing was applied to the pictures obtained with computer vision system and a total of 3810 rice grains were obtained. Furthermore, 7 morphological features have been inferred for each grain.  A data set has been created for the properties obtained.

Attribute Information:
1. Area: Returns the number of pixels within the boundaries of the rice grain.
2. Perimeter: Calculates the circumference by calculating the distance between pixels around the boundaries of the rice grain.
3. Major Axis Length: The longest line that can be drawn on the rice grain, i.e. the main axis distance, gives.
4. Minor Axis Length: The shortest line that can be drawn on the rice grain, i.e. the small axis distance, gives.
5. Eccentricity: It measures how round the ellipse, which has the same moments as the rice grain, is.
6. Convex Area: Returns the pixel count of the smallest convex shell of the region formed by the rice grain.
7. Extent: Returns the ratio of the region formed by the rice grain to the bounding box pixels
8. Class: Commeo and Osmancik.
